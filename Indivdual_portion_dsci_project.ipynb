    "\n",
    "Variables:\n",
    "experience: categorical — indicates the player’s experience level (Amateur, Regular, Veteran, Pro).\n",
    "subscribe: logical — TRUE/FALSE variable showing if the player subscribed to the newsletter.\n",
    "hashedEmail: string — unique encrypted identifier for each player.\n",
    "played_hours: numeric — total number of hours each player has played.\n",
    "name: string — player’s chosen username.\n",
    "gender: categorical — self-reported gender of the player.\n",
    "Age: numeric — age of the player in years.\n",
    "Summary statistics (rounded to 2 decimal places):\n",
    "Mean played_hours: 7.21 hours\n",
    "Standard deviation of played_hours: 9.84 hours\n",
    "Minimum played_hours: 0.00 hours\n",
    "Maximum played_hours: 50.40 hours\n",

    "Missing values: 2 missing Age entries\n",
    "\n",
    "Data quality issues:\n",
    "Some players have 0 hours of playtime, which could mean they never logged in or data was not recorded correctly.\n",
    "Two Age values are missing.\n",
    "experience and gender are categorical and may need conversion to factor type for analysis.\n",
    "The method used to assign experience level is not specified (self-reported or system-defined).\n",
    "Potential unseen issues:\n",
    "Possible inconsistencies in how played_hours was measured (manual entry vs. automated logging).\n",
    "Shared or duplicate accounts could distort individual statistics.\n",
    "Survey-based information (such as gender or experience) could include bias or reporting errors.\n",
    "How data were collected:\n",
    "Likely gathered through a combination of in-game activity tracking and player registration information.\n",
    "Each record corresponds to a unique player profile recorded on the server."
