By combining these datasets using the shared hashedEmail identifier, total playtime for each player can be calculated by summing all session durations. Once the total playtime is computed, it can be compared across different experience levels to see whether higher-experience players tend to play longer overall. Additional variables such as Age and gender can be used to explore whether demographic factors also relate to total playtime."
